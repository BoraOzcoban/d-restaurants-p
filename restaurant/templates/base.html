    <p>I, personally enjoy looking for restaurants online, but sometimes I do not have plenty of time available so using this website in the city of my choice would be really helpful</p>
    <p class="font-weight-bold">If you are a tourist in a city you do not know, it may be better if you use this website instead of searching for a place to eat and thus decreasing the amount of time you will enjoy the city</p>
    <p>Not sure where to go on holiday? You can use the Random Restaurant Selector tool and go to the restaurant it shows. If you are not satisfied with the restaurant and city, just refresh the page :) </p>
    <p class="font-weight-bold">There are probably thousands of restaurants, cafes, and bars near you. So isn't it just silly to go to the same places every time instead of exploring new places that may be as lovely as your favorite places sometimes?</p>

    <p class="font-weight-bold">Turkey is a beautiful country with its magnificent natural beauties such as the Cappadocia, the Aegean coast, green forests of the Black Sea. And its wonderful historical buildings such as the Hagia Sophia, the Blue Mosque, Topkapı Palace.
If you come to Turkey, you will not only get fascinated by the beautiful touristic places, you will also enjoy the delicious Turkish cuisine. You will enjoy eating the most known Turkish dishes such as kebab and döner in their hometown and believe me, you will most certainly love them. But Turkish cuisine is not limited to kebab and döner, here is a list of some awesome Turkish dishes that I have chosen from hundreds of various dishes:
    </p>
    <p>Pide: A doughy meat pie but it also has vegetarian options such as Pide with Cheese. And my favorite type of pide is the pide with grounded meat and eggs. It tastes even better with Ayran.</p>
    <p>Cag Kebab: A special type of kebab from the city of Erzurum, a mountainous city perfect for winter tourism, which is made with Goat or Lamb.</p>
    <p>Simit: As known as Turkish Bagels in the United States and Gevrek in Izmir, it is a delicious circular bread with sesame seeds.</p>
    <p>Cacık: It is salted strained yoghurt with cucumbers, garlic, olive oil and a lot more.</p>
    <p>Lahmacun: Also known as the Turkish Pizza, it is also a pretty good one to try.</p>
    <p>Manti: Turkish dumpling which gets awesome with its special sauce.</p>
    <p>Dolma: Peppers stuffed with rice and meat(not required).</p>
    <p>Boyoz: A Turkish pastry that you can find in İzmir</p>
    <p class="font-weight-bold">Turkish cuisine also has a great variety of delicious sweets and desserts you should try such as:</p>
    <p>Turkish Delight: a small sweet most people eat alongside Turkish Coffee. It has a lot of options that are less or more intense.</p>
    <p>Baklava: A famous layered pastry dessert filled with either pistachio or nuts</p>
    <p>Kazandibi: A caramelized milk pudding you should try.</p>
    <p>Künefe: It is a dessert made with shredded filo pastry.</p>
    <p>Sutlac: Baked Rice Pudding containing milk</p>
    <p class="font-weight-bold">Turkish cuisine also contains awesome drinks you should try such as:</p>
    <p>Ayran: The perfect cold and healthy drink for hot summer days. It is made of yoghurt, salt and water.</p>
    <p>Şalgam: Traditional turnip juice.</p>
    <br>

    <p class = "text-hidden">The data I used for this project is from TripAdvisor Restaurants Info for 31 Euro-Cities dataset by Damien BENESCHI, so it may not contain all the restaurants in the city. Thus, the rankings provided in the last buttons may not be completely accurate. Yet, you can get an idea about whether there are a lot of restaurants offering your favorite cuisine in a city or not.
