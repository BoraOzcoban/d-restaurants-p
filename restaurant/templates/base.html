    <p>I, personally enjoy looking for restaurants online, but sometimes I do not have plenty of time available so using this website in the city of my choice would be really helpful</p>
    <p class="text-dark">If you are a tourist in a city you do not know, it may be better if you use this website instead of searching for a place to eat and thus decreasing the amount of time you will enjoy the city</p>
    <p>Not sure where to go on holiday? You can use the Random Restaurant Selector tool and go to the restaurant it shows. If you are not satisfied with the restaurant and city, just refresh the page :) </p>
    <p class="text-dark">There are probably thousands of restaurants, cafes, and bars near you. So isn't it just silly to go to the same places every time instead of exploring new places that may be as lovely as your favorite places sometimes?</p>

    <br>
    <p>At the moment, the cities available are: <strong> Amsterdam (Netherlands), Athens (Greece), Barcelona (Spain), Berlin (Germany), Bratislava (Slovakia), Bruxelles (Bruxelles), Budapest (Hungary), Copenhagen (Denmark), Dublin (Ireland), Edinburgh (United Kingdom), Geneva (Switzerland), Helsinki (Finland), Hamburg (Germany), Krakow (Poland), Lisbon (Portugal), Ljubljana (Slovenia), London (United Kingdom), Luxembourg (Luxembourg), Madrid (Spain), Lyon (France), Milan (Italy), Munich (Germany), Oporto (Portgual), Oslo (Norway), Paris (France), Prague (Czech Republic), Rome (Italy), Stockholm (Sweden), Vienna (Austria), Warsaw (Poland), Zurich (Switzerland)</strong></p>
    <br>

    <p class = "text-hidden">The data I used for this project is from TripAdvisor Restaurants Info for 31 Euro-Cities dataset by Damien BENESCHI, so it may not contain all the restaurants in the city. Thus, the rankings provided in the last buttons may not be completely accurate. Yet, you can get an idea about whether there are a lot of restaurants offering your favorite cuisine in a city or not.
        And this website was developed recently by me, an amateur programming enthusiast, so if there are any errors that you noticed or if you have any suggestions please feel free to contact me from my Linkedin account which is available on the button below</p>
